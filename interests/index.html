        <h2>Athletic Involvement</h2>
        <p>
          Involvement in sports is a very integral part of my life. I have been involved in sports since before I can 
          remember. I've been playing basketball since the first grade. I started playing softball and running track 
          in the 7th grade. A life without sports is lacking excitement. I played softball and ran track until my junior 
          year in high school when I was injured. My injury junior year was pretty minor in comparison to the injury I
          sustained my senior year of high school. During basketball season my senior year I tore my ACL, LCL, MCL, and 
          and sustained some nerve damage. Since my injury I've been focused on regaining my strength and getting back to
          playig basketball. Along the way I picked up two new hobbies, running and weightlifting. I am now a part of the 
          Women's basketball team at IIT, and hoping to run my first 10k in October this year.

        <h2>Volunteer Experiences</h2>
        <p>
          Aside from sports my favorite thing to do is find volunteer projects. I find a lot of joy and happiness in
          serving. Providing for others in a way they can't provide for themselves, or lessening the workload for someone
          else to make their day easier is a gives me a sense of satisfaction and achievement that I can't obtain any 
          other way. In high school I was a part of National Honor Society (NHS) where we had a certain quota of volunteer
          hours to fufill. Currently on campus I am a part of Circle K which is a student org dedicated to volunteering and
          service. Separate from the student org I am also invovled in many volunteer works with my church. Some of my 
          favorite volunteer experiences include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Teaching at Safety Town</li>
          <li>Serving lunches at the St.James Food Pantry</li>
          <li>Helping in elementary classrooms</li>
