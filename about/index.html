        My name is Raiven Johnson, I am a second year student at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
        My current area of study is Information Technology Management (ITM). I plan to do the 5 year coterminal
        degree and get my Master's in Computer Forensics and Cyber Security. I also plan to minor in software development.
        Inspired by binge watching NCIS, Quantico, CSI, and related shows, after college I hope to start a career in law 
        enforcement, preferably FBI, as a computer forensics analyst. In December of 2016 I am planning to take the CompTIA
        A+ exam to hopefully become A+ certified. Aside from academics I am currently a member of the Women's basketball 
        team at IIT and a member of an on campus organization called CRU(Campus CRUsade for Christ). I also hold 4 on campus 
        jobs, I am a TA for CS, an ARC scholar for ITM, a recreation assistant at the Keating Sports Center, and a production 
        team member for athletic events. I am also volunteering with the St.James food pantry during the week, as well as the 
        South Loop Community church food pantry on the weekends. My newest volunteer works include helping with the children's 
        ministry at church and joining the weekly meeting team CRU. I am always looking for new volunteer projects!
